    "#### Linked Lists & Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked Lists & Arrays are concerned with four main aspects: accessing, searching, inserting, and deleting data. Arrays are fast for accessing data due to their fixed length and contiguous memory allocation, but can be slow for searching, inserting, and deleting, especially with large volumes of data. Dynamic data structures, such as arrays, can expand or shrink to conserve memory, with functions for inserting and removing data. A more efficient method for array expansion and contraction involves doubling the size when full and halving it when usage falls to 25% capacity. Linked structures, an alternative to arrays, consist of nodes containing data and memory pointers, allowing for flexible data access, insertion, and removal.\n",

    "What are concerned with 4 things in a data structure:\n",
    "\t1. ability to access data\n",
    "\t2. ability to search data\n",
    "\t3. ability to insert data\n",
    "\t4. ability to delete data\n",
    "\n",
    "An Array is Fast in Some cases while slow in others. When using a large volume of data, should I use an array or a linked list?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Array - every on accessing data\n",
    "\t- array is a fixed length which is what allows it to go into the computer and allocate a contiguous block of memory to store the x amount of elements and index by a 0 based index\n",
    "\t- computer references an item in the element by memory location\n",
    "\t- array can be very slow at search when…as n increases, time to search can increase\n",
    "\t- insert is problematic b/c it takes a lot of time unless inserting at beginning or very end\n",
    "\t- delete…especially items in the middle\n"
